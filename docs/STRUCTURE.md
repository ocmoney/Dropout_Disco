**Directory Purposes:**

*   **`app/`**: Contains all code directly related to the FastAPI web service that serves predictions.
*   **`data/`**: Holds raw, immutable input datasets.
*   **`docs/`**: Any supplementary documentation, plans, or notes.
*   **`logs/`**: Stores runtime logs generated by the application. This directory is typically mounted as a volume in Docker to persist logs outside the container. Should be ignored by Git.
*   **`models/`**: Stores the output artifacts of model training (saved embeddings, vocabularies, trained regression models). Should be ignored by Git.
*   **`notebooks/`**: For interactive development, experimentation, and visualization (like EDA). Not typically part of the production application.
*   **`scripts/`**: Contains top-level executable scripts that orchestrate processes like training. These scripts import modules from `src/`.
*   **`src/`**: The main library of the project, containing reusable Python modules for model definitions, data processing, and core logic.
